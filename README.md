Minecraft2D is a basic isometric version of Minecraft made in C!
It uses the Windows.h library to help manage the window and to let me manipulate the pixels in the window.
This game uses WASD to move to the sides and uses SHIFT and CTRL to move up and down.
By scrolling you can place a block at the position of the green cursor. 
Blocks such as water and sand have physics! Try what you can do with them :)
